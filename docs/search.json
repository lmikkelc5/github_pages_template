The things I miss most about living there though is living 3 minutes from my neice and nephew but I love a lot of stuff about it as well. I have 4 sisters(yeah I know, it was torture) and we have a dog named Duke and 2 chickens. I love the sunny weather and living in the cold of Utah makes me miss it even more.\nMy dream is to do some type of stats work with the stock market but I am still working out the specifics. I have always loved the stock market even when its losing me money, but I find it very interesting and would love to get even more experience and knowledge about it one day. I am also open to other areas in stats like biostatistics but my main focus is the market.\n\n\n\nThanks for visiting my page and I hope you enjoy what you see! This is a collection of projects I have done in my Stat 386 class and I will add some of my own as well!

    "text": "Diversification of risk is the idea that as you ‘put your eggs in more baskets’ you minimize the overall risk. This is generally discussed within the investing community as a way to minimize the risk of losing large portions of your money. This is a very common principle but one that I think many people could benefit from understanding better.\n\n\n\nThe idea behind diversification is that as you increase the number of investments the chances of more than one dropping significantly decreases drastically. If one of your stocks move down signifiactly, say 25% but it only makes up 5% of your portfolio then you only end up losing 1.25% of your total portfolio value which is a much more manageable portion. This also increases the chance of one of your stocks moving up a significant amount. While diversification does minimize the return you would receive from an increase it increases the chances of you gaining some value in your portfolio. What this does is take your portfolio risk and minimize it. You are stuck with something called market risk but diversification gets rid of most of your portfolio specific risk.\n\n\n\nA graph showing market risk vs portfolio risk\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a chunk of code that visualizes the effect of adding a position to your portfolio.\nCopy this code and change the max_positions variable to see the effect of a different number of positions on risk(standard deviation).\nThis code:  - defines parameters  - creates a matrix  - it then simulates 10,000 portfolios following the parameters  - It then plots the different numbers of positions to show the effects on portfolio risk \nThe graph is for a portfolio size of $10000 with 50 positions.\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n#Parameters you can change\nportfolio_size = 100_000\navg_return = 0.07\nvolatility = 0.20\ncorrelation = 0.1\nmax_positions = 50\nsimulations = 10_000\n\ndef simulate_portfolio(num_positions):\n    weights = np.ones(num_positions) / num_positions\n    \n    # covariance matrix\n    cov_matrix = (volatility**2) * (\n        correlation * np.ones((num_positions, num_positions)) +\n        (1 - correlation) * np.eye(num_positions)\n    )\n    \n    # portfolio variance\n    port_variance = weights @ cov_matrix @ weights.T\n    port_std_dev = np.sqrt(port_variance)\n    \n    return port_std_dev\n\n#simulations\npositions_range = range(1, max_positions+1)\nrisks = [simulate_portfolio(n) for n in positions_range]\n\n# plot it\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,5))\nplt.plot(positions_range, risks, marker=\"o\")\nplt.title(\"Portfolio Risk vs. Number of Positions\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Positions\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Portfolio Risk (Std Dev)\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne measure of risk is The Sharpe Ratio. It is a mathematical formula used to measure risk against the expected return. By measuring risk adjusted return you can judge whether the return to risk ratio is ideal for your risk tolerance. It shows how much risk you have to take to make a certain profit, allowing you to not only predict profit but the risk you expose yourself to in the process of acheiving that profit.\n\\(R_p\\) = The portfolios return \\(R_f\\) = Risk free rate \\(\\sigma_p\\) = Standard Deviation of the portfolios excess return \\[\nThe Sharpe Ratio = (R_p - R_f)/\\sigma_p\n\\]\nThe higher The Sharpe Ratio the better your return to risk is. As you can see above in the chart as you increase the number of positions you decrease the portfolio risk, or \\(\\sigma_p\\). As you decrease the \\(\\sigma_p\\) you end up with a larger quotient or a better risk-adjusted performance.\n\n\n\n\nI am a firm believer that everyone should invest a portion of their savings. One benefit to understanding diversification and risk adjusted return is that people can choose an investment strategy that works for them. Someone younger may want to take a more aggressive approach ie. a higher risk strategy or they may take a safer approach that will compound year after year until they retire. When deciding your approach it’s important to think about your ability to handle risk, your long-term goals and when you plan to need the money. Many people will spread their money out among low-risk, medium risk and higher risk strategies to have a safety net but also to make long term gains. Diversification is the best way to improve your risk-adjusted performance, even if you aren’t constantly computing a Sharpe Ratio everytime you look at a new investment.\nEven if it’s 1 dollar or 1,000, everyone should start letting their money work for them. The sooner you start the more your money can compound and the happier and more financially stable you will be down the road.\nIf you want to learn more about diversification click here."

I agreed to their terms and conditions and then applied for an API key which I received in about 2 min. The data is all public the main concern the terms and conditions focused on is that no one uses the data to try and figure out who individuals are. I was using this data for a much higher level analysis of the dataset as a whole so this was not an issue.\n\n\nGood scraping practices\nTo avoid overloading their servers I did my best to only use the API once for each year of data I pulled.

I had to scan through a list of all the different variables that were available and choose the ones that I wanted included and from there it was only a matter of 1 API call that gave me all the data I could ever want and more for each year.\nCleaning the data: The grunt of what I had to do to clean this data was renaming columns to be less clunky and using provided tables to convert the numbers used for race and sex to be the strings associated with those values. This improved the readability of the data and allowed me to get more comfortable with it.\nInterpretation and summary: I then went through and wrote code that would work on all my years of data to plot and explore the data. While a lot of the charts and graphs I created showed little to nothing due to a lack of correlation I got very familiar with the data and was able to see what was going on inside of it.",
