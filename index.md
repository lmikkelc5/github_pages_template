# Hello! I'm Mikkel Christensen

### Introduction
My name is Mikkel and I grew up in San Diego, CA. Back home I loved going to the beach, surfing, hiking and rock climbing. The things I miss most about living there though is living 3 minutes from my neice and nephew but I love a lot of stuff about it as well. I have 4 sisters(yeah I know, it was torture) and we have a dog named Duke and 2 chickens. I love the sunny weather and living in the cold of Utah makes me miss it even more. 

My dream is to do some type of stats work with the stock market but I am still working out the specifics. I have always loved the stock market even when its losing me money, but I find it very interesting and would love to get even more experience and knowledge about it one day. I am also open to other areas in stats like biostatistics but my main focus is the market.

### Mission Statement
Thanks for visiting my page and I hope you enjoy what you see! This is a collection of projects I have done in my Stat 386 class and I will add some of my own as well! I look forward to using this page to motivate me to complete projects and work on things that interest me and help me learn more about stats.

## üéì About This Portfolio

This portfolio shows my work learning data science. Each project includes:

- My code with documentation
- Visualizations I created
- What I learned and discovered

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills I'm Learning

- **Programming**: Python, Pandas for data analysis, R, Julia, C++
- **Visualization**: Creating charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Data Collection**: Getting data from files, websites, and APIs
- **Analysis**: Finding patterns and answering questions with data
