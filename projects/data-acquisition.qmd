## Introduction
This project explores data from The Census Bureau API. I pulled the data from the state of California (my home state). I manipulated the data and cleaned it and then began to research questions I had. A lot of these questions are things that I wondered about previously and ones that arose as I explored the dataset that I had created.

## Motivating question (what are you hoping to learn from this data?)

 - **Is there a correlation between peoples income and if they own a cell phone or not?**
 - Is there a correlation between income and age?
 - Is there a correlation between race and if they own a cell phone or not?

I explored all of these questions but in the end I chose to focus more on the correlation between income and smartphone ownership.

### How do I know this was ethical?
The process for getting this data was actually quite simple. I agreed to their terms and conditions and then applied for an API key which I received in about 2 min. The data is all public the main concern the terms and conditions focused on is that no one uses the data to try and figure out who individuals in the dataset are. I was using this data for a much higher level analysis of the dataset as a whole so this was not an issue.

### Good scraping practices
To avoid overloading their servers I did my best to only use the API once for each year of data I pulled. I also did not ever put it in a loop, which you can do but since it didn't make sense I didn't, and this made it so that I didn't pull the data over and over again without needing to. My API key is also saved in seperate folder that won't be uploaded to github to protect it.

## Summary
The API call: One of the benefits I learned about APIs is that it makes collecting the data a lot simpler than if I were to webscrape it piece by piece from a website. I had to scan through a list of all the different variables that were available and choose the ones that I wanted included and from there it was only a matter of 1 API call that gave me all the data I could ever want and more for each year.

Cleaning the data: The grunt of what I had to do to clean this data was renaming columns to be less clunky and using provided tables to convert the numbers used for race and sex to be the strings associated with those values. This improved the readability of the data and allowed me to get more comfortable with it. 

Interpretation and summary: I then went through and wrote code that would work on all my years of data to plot and explore the data. While a lot of the charts and graphs I created showed little to nothing due to a lack of correlation I got very familiar with the data and was able to see what was going on inside of it. This led me to the final observations I made and the trends I was able to identify.

## EDA highlights: 

### Findings
After finding a lack of correlation between smartphones and income I compared the trend of the correlation coefficients year to year to see if it was decreasing over time. This yielded results which I will show below.

### Fisher's Test
Fisher's V Test: This tests whether 2 correlation coefficients are significantly different from each other. After testing the correlation between the 3 years of data I ran Fishers V test to see if the years 2021 and 2023 were statistically different and I got a p-value of 0.0000000003. Since this p-value is less than 0.05 we know that the difference is statistically significant.

## What are the most interesting findings of your EDA?

The fact that the correlation between income and smartphones is decreasing over time shows that phones are moving farther from discretionary items and closer to necessities in todays world. I find this quite interesting, especially since this trend shows up from 2021-2023. I wish I could've tested farther back but before 2021 the Census did not have data on smartphones. I imagine this trend is even stronger the close you get to when smartphones entered out society. It also goes to show the magnitude of the impact that smartphones have had upon our society. Even something that is generally pretty expensive compared other necessities is owned by a very large portion of people (~97.1% in 2023) and barely decreases in ownership under the poverty line. I think that this says a lot about our society and the weight we place on our technology. I do think it shows something as well that this far into the trend, even dealing with tiny correlation coefficients we are able to see a statistically significant trend in the correlation. At first I was annoyed that I wasn't able to find any correlation in the data but by comparing the coefficients I was able to find a trend that taught me something about what I was researching.
